# Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for Binary Classification

## Project Overview 🚀

Welcome to the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Binary Classification project! In this exploration, we delve into predicting whether a customer will stay or exit a service based on various characteristics.

## Step 1: Installation and Setup ⚙️

Start by installing TensorFlow, a powerful library for machine learning and deep learning. Confirm the installation by checking the version, ensuring you have the necessary tools for the project.

## Step 2: Data Preprocessing 📊

1. **Importing the Dataset:**
   - Begin by introducing the dataset, often represented as a table, containing information about customers.

2. **Selecting Dependent and Independent Variables:**
   - Identify the features (independent variables) and the target variable (dependent variable) that we aim to predict.

3. **Encoding Categorical Data:**
   - Transform categorical data (like country or gender) into a format suitable for the model, ensuring it can understand and process this information.

4. **Splitting the Dataset:**
   - Divide the dataset into two parts: one for training the model and another for testing its performance.

5. **Feature Scaling:**
   - Normalize the data, bringing all features to a standard scale. This ensures no single feature dominates the model training.

## Step 3: Building the Model 🛠️

Construct an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), a computational model inspired by the human brain. The network consists of layers, each serving a specific purpose in understanding patterns within the data.

## Step 4: Training the Model 🚂

Teach the model to recognize patterns in the training data. This involves adjusting weights and biases in the network to minimize the difference between predicted and actual outcomes.

## Step 5: Model Evaluation and Prediction 📈

1. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Assess the model's performance on a separate set of data it has not seen before, known as the test set.

2. **Model Prediction:**
   - Apply the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

3. **Confusion Matrix:**
   - Use a confusion matrix to understand how well the model distinguishes between positive and negative outcomes. The accuracy score provides an overall measure of its effectiveness.

## Project Results 🎉

While the model demonstrates promising results, examining the confusion matrix reveals potential areas for improvement, especially in correctly predicting positive outcomes.

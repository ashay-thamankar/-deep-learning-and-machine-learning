# Loan E-Signing Predictive Modeling

## Overview ðŸš€

Welcome to the Loan E-Signing Predictive Modeling project repository! This project aims to analyze a dataset related to the e-signing of loans based on financial history and build a predictive model using XGBoost Classifier to understand and predict e-signing behavior.

## Dataset Overview ðŸ“‘

The dataset consists of 17,908 entries with 21 features, including user details, financial information, and e-signing status. The primary objective is to explore the data, preprocess it, and develop a machine learning model to predict whether a user will e-sign a loan.

## Project Structure ðŸ“‚

- **Part 1: Data Processing**: Loading the dataset, exploring its structure, and preparing it for analysis.
- **Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing and visualizing the data to gain insights.
- **Part 3: Model Building**: Implementing machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- **Part 4: Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using Randomized Search to find optimal hyperparameters for the XGBoost model.
- **Part 5: Final Model**: Building and evaluating the final XGBoost Classifier.

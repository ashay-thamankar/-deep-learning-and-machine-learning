## Introduction üöÄ

Student performance is a critical aspect of the education system, and understanding the factors influencing academic success can provide valuable insights for educators and policymakers. In this project, we employ machine learning to predict student performance based on demographic information and study habits.

## Dataset Exploration üìä

### Data Overview

The dataset contains information about students, including their gender, parental education, study time, and academic performance. Exploring and preprocessing the data is the initial step in building an effective predictive model.

### Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and other preprocessing steps are crucial for preparing the data for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) üìà

Exploratory Data Analysis involves visualizing and interpreting the dataset to extract meaningful insights. Let's explore some key aspects:
